The main things that separate Hazard 6 from Hazard 5 are that 1) enemies spawn more frequently 
(less downtime and forgiving for idling around), 2) enemy compositions are more diverse and chaotic 
(majority of the enemies aren't just regular grunts or swarmers that can easily be dealt with), 
and 3) enemies are a lot faster (and therefore are a lot more lethal).
